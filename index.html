        <p>
            Welcome to Noticed, The Goods’ design trend column. You know that thing you’ve been seeing all over the
            place? Allow us to explain it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="para-start">What it is:</span> A digital or print effect
            where one
            color
            fades
            into another. Typically rendered in soft or
            pastel tones.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="para-start">Where it is:</span> Gradients are seemingly everywhere in media and
            marketing. They are part of a suite of Facebook
            status backdrops introduced in 2017 and the branding for the New York Times’ popular podcast The Daily,
            which displays a yellow to blue gradient.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gradients have taken over Coachella’s app and website (if you watch carefully, the colors shift). Ally’s
            billboard in A Star Is Born is a full-on gradient, and so was the branding for the Oscars ceremony that
            recognized Lady Gaga.
        </p>
        <p>
            On Instagram, they provide a product backdrop for popular Korean beauty brand Glow, and have been embraced
            by indie magazines Gossamer and Anxy — both designed by Berkeley studio Anagraph.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the luxury front, Brooklyn wallpaper company Calico has released an entire collection of gradient
            wallpapers called Aurora. Meanwhile, Spanish fashion house Loewe has introduced a version of their trendy
            Elephant bag in a spectrum of pink to yellow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Are gradients drinkable? Heck yes, they are. Seltzer startup Recess has gone all-in on gradients in their
            branding.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="para-start">Why you’re seeing it everywhere:</span> Gradients are the confluence of three
            different trends: Light and Space
            art, vaporwave, and bisexual lighting.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the art and design world, Light and Space — developed in the 1960s and ’70s — has been experiencing a
            revival
            thanks to its Instagramability. Light and Space pioneer James Turrell has been embraced by celebrities like
            Beyoncé,
            Drake, and Kanye West. Drake’s Hotline Bling video was inspired by Turrell’s light-infused rooms called
            Ganzfelds. The
            Kardashian-Jenner-West crew posted an Instagram in front of one of Turrell’s works in Los Angeles. (I was
            yelled at by
            security for taking a picture there but it’s fine.)

                1. The Colourful Gradients have brought a massive outlook on contemporization in the design world as a
                whole.</span>
        </p>
        <p>This article puts a spotlight on Daisy Alioto’s write-up on digital aesthetics in design. It shows us how
            various
            business companies, news podcast agencies, music festivals, brandings of various firms, ceremonies and
            application
            designs have seamlessly draped distinct gradients to their appearance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="para-start">2. Effectively holds up to the contemporary practice of interaction design.</span>
        </p>
        <p>The alluring look of gradients not only appeals visually but also has merit in interaction design towards the
            targeted audience. A good example from the reading was how Facebook implemented gradients for a text back in
            2017.
            Since the platform was on a verge of losing the enthusiasm of its users to share their personal data, the
            company came
            with a ‘gradient status background’. Facebook wants our personal data, as much as possible. Hence, colourful
            backgrounds encouraged users to post information about themselves and friends to ‘Like’ it and ‘comment’.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="para-start">3. The author successfully conveys the impact of gradients have change on the
                viewer's viewpoint.</span></p>
        <p>Gradients have not only been setting up successful interactional examples but also the viewer’s POV towards
            certain notions. Other than a good communication scope in branding or app designs, it is seen that there
            also was
            merit in positioning a viewpoint + creating an experience. The author has mentioned two aspects of gradient
            usability in this article.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first example is: A Brooklyn wallpaper company Calico had released an entire collection of gradient
            wallpapers called Aurora. Their wallpapers make the viewers immerse in waves and washes of atmospheric
            colour. It
            focused on building the relationship between light, colour, place and mood. Inspired by the horizons at dawn
            and the
            phenomena of light. The brand explored the emotions expressed by the ever-changing sky for its user
            experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second example is: Tati Pastukhova, co-founder of interactive art space ARTECHOUSE, says gradients have
            become more popular as computer display quality increases. She says the appeal of gradients is “the illusion
            of dimension, and giving 2-D designs 3-D appeal.” ARTECHOUSE is full of light-based digital installations,
            but visitors naturally gravitate toward what is most photogenic — including, unexpectedly, the soft lighting
            the space installed along their staircase for safety reasons.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="para-start">4. My takeaway from this reading.</span></p>

        <p>In this article, the author has given me a sense of how trends in media & design keep updating over time.
            Every new
            trend has its own speciality and each has its own time to sustain. For example: Before gradients, neon
            lettering was the
            Instagram lighting aesthetic du jour (short-lived popularity). On the other hand, the gradients are
            something that shows
            no sign of slowing down. As the article speaks, many artists in their music videos, festivals in their
            brand’s
            communication and companies for their apps have been courageously incorporating it. It elevates any design.
            There are a
            ton of opportunities to incorporate the gradient trend into your web design. It can be used as a combination
            of soft
            colours for a subtle background. It can add a fun, funky vibe with a photo overlay. You can make a big
            impact without
            being visually overwhelming by adding a gradient with bold colours to design accents. When it comes to
            gradients in web
            design, pretty much anything goes so taking the advantage of the smorgasbord of opportunities, and
            incorporating this
            trend into a web design would itself be an experience.
